This project is about the paper “Data Shunt: Collaboration of Small and Large Models for Lower Costs and Better Performance,” aiming to enhance the overall performance through the collaboration between pre-trained large models and specialized small models. When the pre-trained large model is a paid service, reducing the frequency of invoking the large model can effectively lower the associated costs.
